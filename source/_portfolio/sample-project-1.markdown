I generated this prestyled page by running command: `$ rake new_project["Sample Project 1"]` and adding `sample-project-1` (the file basename) to the portfolio index page settings.

Then, I added images to the `source/images/sample-project-1/` directory that was automatically created when I ran the new_project rake task, and those images populate the gallery carousel below. Wow!
