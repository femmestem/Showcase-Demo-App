I generated this prestyled page by running command: `$ rake new_project["Sample Project 1"]` and adding `sample-project-1` (the file basename) to the portfolio index page settings.

Since I didn't add any images to this project's page settings, the gallery carousel is hidden. If I add images to the `source/images/sample-project-2/` directory that was automatically created when I ran the new_project rake task, then the gallery carousel would appear below and it would be populated with those images. Wow!
